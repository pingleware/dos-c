1. Update the to-do list.  Any feedback?

DOS-C to do list for v0.90a
---------------------------

Date: September 2, 1995


1. Eliminate the forcing the f_node into R/W mode in dos_findnext and
make it RO.  A directory search will never modify the entry.  Also modify
the comments to reflect what is really going on.

2. Correct the typo in the rdwr block comment (tp).  Also eliminate DOS/NT
references in the comments.

3. Add a REV_MAGIC for the "ZM" exe headre case.  Although this header has
been encountered, it best to guarantee loading it since MS-DOS does.

4. Add a CDS structure for join and subst commands.

5. DosExec forces a com file to be at least sizeof exe.  Should be able to
accept a one byte program (theoretically).

6. In dosfns, should call the device open and device close driver calls if
if the file is a device.  This allows for device initialization and orderly
shutdown.

7. If we duplicate a handle, we must make certain that a close updates the
directory entry.

8. FcbRead order of evaluating the return from dos_read must be changed.
The zero case never executes.

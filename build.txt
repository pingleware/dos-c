To build the operating system, a batch file (BUILD.BAT) is included to make 
life easier.  This file is in the dos-c directory of the distribution.  In
addition, there is a corresponding batch file (CLEAN.BAT) to clean up the 
source directories.

If you feel hardy, read on to understand the directory structure.  A more
complete description of the build environment is contained ina companion 
book, "The FreeDOS Kernel" (ISBN: 0-87930-436-7) published by R&D Books, an 
imprint of Miller Freeman of Lawrence, Kansas (USA) and distributed in the 
USA and Canada by Publishers Group West.  See the file README.TXT for more 
details.


Directory Structure
-------------------

dos-c				root directory
  +-----dist			holds image of distribution disk
  +-----doc			documentation directory
  +-----hdr			common *.h files
  +-----lib			LIBM.LIB and DEVICE.LIB
  +-----src			source directories for:
  +--------+-----boot		boot.bin
  +--------+-----command	COMMAND.COM and HELP.EXE
  +--------+-----drivers	DEVICE.LIB
  +--------+-----fs		common kernel and ipl fs manage files
  +--------+-----ipl		IPL.SYS
  +--------+-----kernel		KERNEL.EXE
  +--------+-----misc		miscellaneous files for kernel and ipl
  +--------+-----tmp
  +--------+-----utils		SYS.EXE


Organization in a nutshell
--------------------------
Each component or group of utilities is segreagated into its own directory.  
Whenever common files are needed, they are removed and placed into a 
seperate directory.  In order to build that component or utility, a makefile 
exists in the directory that bears the component's or utility's basename.

Each makefile has at least two targets, production and clean.  The target 
production builds the expected component or utility and the component clean 
cleans up the director for distribution.  The makefile may have at least one 
additonal target that builds ythe component.  Study the makefile to better 
understand this.

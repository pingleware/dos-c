Known bugs with DOS-C release 0.91
----------------------------------
1. Due my misunderstanding the functionality of the exe loader when the exe 
file is to be loaded high, it is incorrectly handled.  This may cause DOS-C 
to crash.  This will be corrected in the next release.

2. Drive D is a mess.  The driver does not correctly handle the partition 
table resulting in file system corruption.  **DO NOT USE DRIVE D**.  This 
will be corrected in the next release.

3. The disk device driver expects a drive C to be present.  This will be 
corrected in the next release.
